// Implementation notes:
//
// #pragma is not usable within preprocessor macros, but
// every modern compiler supports a macro-compatible way
// to specify pragmas.  MSVC uses __pragma(...) and C99
// uses _Pragma("...").  Also, the original attempt to
// implement this had the packing size (hard-coded to 1
// above) as a parameter.  Unfortunately, GCC fails to
// preprocess in the correct order, so stringizing and
// string literal concatenation don't work for the
// parameter to _Pragma, preventing anything but hard-
// coded parameter strings.  Feel free to add another
// macro here for defining custom packing if you can
// find a well-supported way to do it.  Also, do not
// remove the blank lines in these macros!  They are
// protecting code that comes after the CU_PACK macros
// from ending up on the same line as macro-compatible
// pragmas, which may be bad on some compilers.
